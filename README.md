# Infertility After Abortion: Insights from Data Analysis in R
<br>
This project, "Infertility after Spontaneous and Induced Abortion," is designed to analyze the potential link between different types of abortion and subsequent infertility. I chose to conduct the analysis in R to showcase my proficiency in this powerful statistical programming language.

 I chose to conduct the analysis in R to showcase my proficiency in this powerful statistical programming language, which is widely used in the field of Data Science. R's versatility in data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization makes it an essential tool for analyzing complex healthcare datasets. By demonstrating my skills in R, I aim to highlight my ability to handle real-world datasets, conduct thorough statistical analyses, and create meaningful insights that can drive informed decision-making in my Data Science career. I perform many Exploratory Data Analyses (EDA) and build many Machine learning algorithms.
From Frustration to Fulfillment: My Overall Experience with Data:
  These were all technical details; now let's turn to how I felt throughout this process. While I didn’t face much difficulty with the rest of the analyses and tasks, logistic regression posed a significant challenge. I’ve already mentioned that the instability was the main issue, which made it very tough for me. I spent almost eight hours trying to find a stable pattern. I removed outliers' multiple times, but my code failed again and again, yielding no results. Errors kept appearing, all for just one logistic regression. Eventually, I succeeded, and I realized that some datasets are inherently unstable, and no stable pattern can be derived from them.
During this time, I also used search engines for help. I have several well-known books on R in PDF format, and I preferred consulting them for assistance. I went through all these books because I wanted to strengthen my foundation. A few of these books are
R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, Garrett Grolemund
Practical Statistics for Data Scientists: 50+ Essential Concepts Using R and Python
An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani.
I had an interesting experience: when I completed my previous projects using Tableau and Power BI, I didn’t feel as much joy. The experience wasn’t as significant as what I felt during R coding. Perhaps it’s because those projects were mostly click-based and didn’t require as much effort as coding, which demands significant hard work and focus. When my code failed, I felt frustrated, but I didn’t give up. I would revisit the books, use search engines to seek help, and try to identify the problem. The R documentation helped me immensely, and most of the assistance I got was from the official R documentation and websites.
I had a unique experience when my code finally worked, and a graph appeared in front of me. The happiness and energy I felt at that moment was something I had never experienced before. During learning, everything is explained, and you're guided by the instructor, but the joy of solving something on your own is completely different—extraordinary, even. If you’ve read this far into my project, I hope that you have enjoyed my work.
